# Recommender-Systems---Collaborative-Filtering
Collaborative Filtering This method makes automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users (collaborating).
 
The underlying assumption of the collaborative filtering approach is that if a person A has the same opinion as a person B on a set of items, A is more likely to have B's opinion for a given item than that of a randomly chosen person.
